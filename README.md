This repository provides Python scripts built on Ocean Networks Canada API to search for available devices by property and order data products from the Oceans 3.0 server. This toolbox of functions allows the user to search the Oceans 3.0 database to find instrument deployments for a given time range and geographic extent. Users can additionally define a polygon of geogrpahic coordiantes to further restrict the search area. Data orders will also automatically generate a metadata csv file, and the "write_shp" function can be run to subsequently generate shapefiles for input into GIS software. 

Please see the "toolbox_example.py" for an example application.
